#  AWS Cloud-Based Intelligent Chatbot  

This project is a **cloud-enabled intelligent chatbot** developed in Python to handle user queries efficiently using scalable cloud infrastructure. The system leverages AWS services, including **AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB**, to provide high availability, low latency, and reliable performance in a serverless environment.  

The chatbot follows a modular architecture, enabling easy maintenance, extensibility, and seamless cloud integration while ensuring secure data processing and real-time responsiveness.
